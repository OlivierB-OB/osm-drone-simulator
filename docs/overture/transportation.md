# Overture Maps — Transportation Theme

The transportation theme models the road and rail network as a topological graph. It uses two complementary feature types: **segments** (edges) carry geometry and attributes, while **connectors** (nodes) define where segments meet and enable routing.

**Theme name:** `transportation`

---

## Feature Types

- [connector](#connector) — network node at a junction or endpoint
- [segment](#segment) — network edge with road/rail attributes and linear rules

---

## connector

A point where two or more segments meet. Connectors define the topology of the transportation graph without carrying travel-cost or attribute data themselves.

**Geometry types:** `Point`

### Properties

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Yes | GERS identifier |
| `bbox` | object | Yes | Bounding box |
| `theme` | string | Yes | `"transportation"` |
| `type` | string | Yes | `"connector"` |
| `version` | integer | Yes | Feature version |
| `sources` | array | Yes | Source provenance records |
| `level` | integer | No | Vertical level (0 = ground, negative = tunnel, positive = bridge) |
| `source_tags` | object | No | Raw upstream tags |
| `cartography` | object | No | Rendering hints |

Connectors are referenced by segments via the `connectors` array. A segment's start and end points correspond to the first and last connector in that list.

---

## segment

A directed or undirected edge in the transportation network. Carries geometry, classification, travel rules, and linearly-referenced attributes.

**Geometry types:** `LineString`

### Road-Specific Fields

Applies when `subtype` is `"road"`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `road_class` | string | Functional road class (see RoadClass) |
| `road_surface` | string | Pavement surface type (see RoadSurface) |
| `road_flags` | array | Linearly-referenced boolean road characteristics (see RoadFlagRule) |
| `speed_limits` | array | Linearly-referenced speed limit rules (see SpeedLimitRule) |
| `access_restrictions` | array | Linearly-referenced access rules (see AccessRestrictionRule) |
| `width_rules` | array | Linearly-referenced lane/width rules |
| `lanes` | object | Lane count and direction configuration |
| `is_link` | boolean | `true` for on/off ramps and connector links |
| `is_private` | boolean | `true` for private roads |
| `turn_restrictions` | array | Turn restriction records at junctions |

---

### Rail-Specific Fields

Applies when `subtype` is `"rail"`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `rail_class` | string | Rail network class (see RailClass) |
| `is_electrified` | boolean | `true` if the line is electrified |
| `gauge` | integer | Track gauge in millimeters |
| `max_speed` | integer | Maximum operating speed in km/h |
| `is_freight` | boolean | `true` if the line carries freight |
| `is_high_speed` | boolean | `true` for high-speed rail lines |
| `rail_flags` | array | Linearly-referenced boolean rail characteristics (see RailFlagRule) |

---

### Water-Specific Fields

Applies when `subtype` is `"water"`. Water segments carry no subtype-specific fields; only the [Core Properties](#core-properties) apply.

> **Note:** Water segments are skipped during parsing (`OvertureParser.ts`). Water bodies are already rendered via the base land/water layer, so processing them as transport features would cause misclassification artifacts.

## Linearly-Referenced Rules

Some attributes vary along a segment's length. Overture encodes these as arrays of rule objects, each optionally scoped to a portion of the segment and/or conditional on vehicle/time context.

### Position Reference

The `between` field uses normalized [0.0, 1.0] coordinates along the segment's LineString:

```
between: [0.0, 1.0]   → entire segment
between: [0.25, 0.75] → middle half of the segment
between: [0.0, 0.5]   → first half only
```

### SpeedLimitRule

```
{
  "between": [0.0, 1.0],   // optional; defaults to entire segment
  "value": 50,             // speed limit value
  "unit": "km_h",          // "km_h" or "mph"
  "when": {                // optional conditions
    "heading": "forward",  // "forward", "backward", or omitted for both
    "vehicle": ["motor_vehicle"],
    "time": <OpeningHours expression>
  }
}
```

### AccessRestrictionRule

```
{
  "between": [0.0, 1.0],   // optional; defaults to entire segment
  "access_type": "denied", // "denied" or "allowed"
  "when": {
    "heading": "forward",
    "vehicle": ["hgv", "bus"],
    "time": <OpeningHours expression>
  }
}
```

The `when.vehicle` field accepts an array of vehicle type strings:
`motor_vehicle`, `motorcar`, `motorcycle`, `hgv`, `bus`, `bicycle`, `pedestrian`, `emergency`, `taxi`

## Topology Model

```
connector A ──── segment 1 ──── connector B ──── segment 2 ──── connector C
                                      │
                                  segment 3
                                      │
                                 connector D
```

- Each segment's `connectors` array lists its endpoint connector IDs in order.
- Segments sharing a connector are connected in the graph.
- `level` on segment and connector enables grade-separated crossings (e.g. bridge over tunnel) without a shared connector.
