# Overture Maps Schema Reference

Overture Maps Foundation publishes open map data with a structured, versioned schema. Unlike OSM (which uses free-form key/value tags), Overture data is strongly typed with explicit field names, types, and enumerations — making it easier to parse and validate programmatically.

## Themes

| Theme | Feature Types | Description |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| [base](base.md) | `bathymetry`, `infrastructure`, `land`, `land_cover`, `land_use`, `water` | Physical geography and man-made infrastructure |
| [buildings](buildings.md) | `building`, `building_part` | Building footprints and 3D part geometry |
| [transportation](transportation.md) | `connector`, `segment` | Road and rail network topology |

## GERS Identifier

Every Overture feature carries a **GERS ID** (`id` field) — a globally unique, stable identifier managed by the Global Entity Reference System. GERS IDs persist across dataset releases, enabling reliable cross-referencing and change detection.

Format: UUID string (e.g. `08f2a8bfa5a6b5c90368df4f5c3f1234`)

## Cross-Cutting Schema Patterns

These fields appear across multiple themes and follow consistent conventions:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string (UUID) | Yes | Globally unique GERS identifier |
| `bbox` | object | Yes | Bounding box: `xmin`, `ymin`, `xmax`, `ymax` (WGS84 degrees) |
| `theme` | string | Yes | Theme name (e.g. `base`, `buildings`, `transportation`) |
| `type` | string | Yes | Feature type within the theme |
| `version` | integer | Yes | Feature version; increments on each update |
| `sources` | array | Yes | List of source records: `{dataset, record_id, confidence, update_time}` |
| `names` | object | No | Localized names: `primary` (string) + `common` (map of language→string) |
| `level` | integer | No | Vertical level relative to ground (0 = ground, negative = underground) |
| `source_tags` | object | No | Raw key/value tags preserved from the upstream source |
| `wikidata` | string | No | Wikidata QID (e.g. `Q42`) for linked-data integration |
| `cartography` | object | No | Rendering hints: `min_zoom`, `max_zoom`, `sort_key` |

## Data Format

Overture data is distributed as **GeoParquet** files partitioned by theme and region. Each row is a GeoJSON-compatible feature with a `geometry` column (WKB-encoded) and typed property columns.
